# 🐙 How to Push to GitHub

Since Git wasn't found on your system, follow these steps to upload your code.

## Limit: 2 Options

### Option A: Install Git & Run Script (Recommended)
1. **Download Git**: [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2. **Install**: Run the installer (click "Next" through defaults).
3. **Run Script**: Double-click the `push_code.bat` file I created in this folder.
   - It will automatically run all commands for you.
   - It connects to: `https://github.com/veddhanani4/Profitlens-Ai.git`

---

### Option B: Drag & Drop (Manual)
1. Open your repository: [https://github.com/veddhanani4/Profitlens-Ai](https://github.com/veddhanani4/Profitlens-Ai)
2. Click **Add file** → **Upload files**.
3. Select all files in this folder (`Ctrl+A`) (excluding `node_modules` if present).
4. Drag them into the browser window.
5. Wait for upload to finish.
6. Type "Initial commit" in the commit message box.
7. Click **Commit changes**.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**"Repository not found"**
- Ensure you have actually created the repository `Profitlens-Ai` on your GitHub account `veddhanani4`.
- If not, create it here: https://github.com/new

**"Permission denied"**
- If the script asks for a password, it's safer to sign in via the browser prompt if available.
- Or use a [Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) as your password.
